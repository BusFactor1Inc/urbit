            ** [ray_lid] is the cap pointer at the end of the calculation.

            ** [ray_lip] to [l->ray_cap] region A.

            ** discarded after (nock gus dep) completes.  The question is
            ** whether it can be discarded *before* this link completion.
            **
            ** We know [dep] is a static formula.  So only [gus], the
            ** subject we have just produced, can point into A or B.  
            **

            **
            ** If not, we may tamp - relocating [gus] as we elide region B,
            ** and slide region A down on top of it.  If not, we can't.
            **
            ** Without tail optimization, nolt cannot loop without leaking.
            **
            ** Note that both detecting and applying this optimization has
            ** a cost of the same order as the size of A.  Moreover, if we
            ** fail to apply the optimization, we consume this same order of
            ** memory.  Consistency minimizes performance surprises.
